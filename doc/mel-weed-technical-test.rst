Provide your public key
----------------------

Before a **device firmware update** (DFU), you must prepare your device by replacing the existing bootloader with one that uses your own public key.

Copy the ``public_key.c`` file from where you generated it to ``<InstallFolder>\project\bootloader_secure\dfu_public_key.c``.


Prepare the bootloader
----------------------

1.	Compile a new bootloader using either Keil Î¼Vision or GCC. 

#. Flash the compiled bootloader to the device. Remember to program the Softdevice as well.


Run DFU
-------

The following procedure involves using a phone or tablet with nRF Connect for mobile installed to run DFU:

#.	Transfer the DFU zip package to your phone.

#.	Power on the device. 

#.  Open nRFConnect on your phone.

#.	Click **Scan**. From the available discovered devices, connect to your device. 

    .. note::
        The discovered devices list doesn't automatically refresh when devices stop advertising. If you can't connect to a device from the list, refresh the list to see if the device is still available. 

#.	Expand the **Secure DFU Service** section. There are two icons to the right of **DFU Control Point**:

  a. Check (x) the box to turn notifications **on**.

  b. Check (x) the box to the left to set the device to **bootloader (DFU)** mode. 

#. Click **OK** when prompted to reset the device to bootloader.
